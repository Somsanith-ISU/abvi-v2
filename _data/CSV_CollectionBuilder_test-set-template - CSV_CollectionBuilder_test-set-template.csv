A organ plays dramatic intro music, then continues quietly behind speaker voice]

[Dramatic male speaking voice]:

As an army terrible with batters sweeping before it the black shades of night, routing despair, comes the flaming truth of the God law.

Why do you suffer the indignities of life, when you can control life? Your fate is in your hands now, for at last, the way is open, if you will but take it. 
When Dr. Frank B Robinson first realized the dynamic implications of Psychiana, he was in debt, a humble drug clerk with no future, no hope. Now he possesses all that he wants of wealth, his mind is at peace, and he is accorded praise and renown as an outstanding and famous psychologist. The same forces that raised him out of the depths, to stand on a high plane among men, can be put to work for you."
